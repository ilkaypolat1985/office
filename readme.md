# Requirements

Refactor the code to make it as clean as you can. Please keep in mind the following:

 * As for any refactor, the functionality should not change
 * Consider that nothing is yet delivered, meaning: 
    * Feel free to improve the database design if you find it necessary 
    * Feel free to improve rest interface if you find it necessary
 * Write a short summary or a list of the improvements you made.
